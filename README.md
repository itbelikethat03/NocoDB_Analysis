# ðŸ“Š NocoDB vs. MySQL: Performance Analysis & AI-Enhanced Insights

This project compares the performance of data retrieval between **NocoDB (via REST API)** and **MySQL**, and extends into **AI-driven sentiment analysis** and **interactive data visualization** using Python. It combines backend integration, data analysis, and applied NLP with real-world datasets.

## ðŸš€ Main Objectives

- Benchmark data retrieval speeds: NocoDB (API) vs. direct MySQL
- Test hypotheses using large review datasets (Yelp & Steam)
- Create interactive location-based heatmaps
- Train sentiment classification using **BERT**
- Demonstrate real-world API and webhook integration
